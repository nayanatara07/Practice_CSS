## Introduction

This project is a simple HTML gallery featuring friends, each with a brief description. The gallery is styled using CSS to create a visually appealing and responsive layout.

## CSS Styles

### 1. Flexbox Layout

The gallery layout is achieved using Flexbox. The container with the class `flexbox` uses the `display: flex` property to arrange the friend cards in a row. Each individual card is a flex item.

### 2. Card Styling

Each friend card, with the class `card`, is styled with the following properties:
- `border-radius`: Adds rounded corners to the card.
- `box-shadow`: Provides a subtle shadow effect to lift the card.
- `margin`: Creates space between the cards.
- `padding`: Adds internal spacing for better readability.

### 3. Image Styling

The friend images, with the class `card-img`, are styled with:
- `max-width`: Ensures that the images do not exceed the width of their container.
- `border-radius`: Adds rounded corners to the images.

### 4. Text Styling

The text within the friend cards is styled for better readability:
- `font-family`: Specifies a clean and readable font.
- `font-size`: Provides a consistent font size for all text.
- `line-height`: Ensures appropriate spacing between lines for readability.
- `color`: Sets the text color for a clear contrast.

### 5. Icons

The heart (like) and bookmark icons are styled with the `bi` (Bootstrap Icons) class. These icons have a consistent size and color to maintain a clean and cohesive appearance.

### 6. Responsive Design

Media queries are used to make the gallery responsive, ensuring a pleasant viewing experience on various devices. The layout adjusts based on the screen size to maintain readability and aesthetics.

## Usage

Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the friends gallery. The CSS styling enhances the visual presentation of the gallery.
